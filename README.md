# wawaho_burgers_and_fries
What if intellectually disabled adults had access to menu items so clear that their needs were met without a communication barrier? In comes Wawaho Burgers and Fries. 
Abstract-
I am attempting to make a dancing burger. Why did I name it Wawaho? Wawaho is all-encompassing. Everything is fabulous. Everything is going to be okay all the time, even when it's not. Therefore, the burgers served at Wawaho Burgers and Fries are perfect all of the time. They might need to be cut into quarters. They might need to be tapped with two fingers. They might need to be held above one's face so one can determine that they are a legit burger. They might be eaten in the middle of watching "The Little Mermaid", which is the greatest Disney movie of all time, and came out in 1989. It was also the part of the cinematic rennaisance that saved Disney from bankruptcy, and is in fact the only animated movie wherein an octopus woman shimmies and obsessively reapplies her lipstick. But I digress...
Programs and Devices Used: It is my understanding that I am to use MYSQL, Heroku, the command line,seed.sql,and other things.  
Unfortunately and fortunately, I knew that if I connected this with someone dear to me, I would work harder. I have a deployable app in Heroku. It's not a cooperative app, but it's an app nonetheless. I cannot for the life of me connect MYSQL and Jaws_DB. I know that I will know how to do this soon. I connected Github and Heroku. I answered somebody else's question about SQL correctly. Somebody check the basement for pod people. I want this to be the most amazing app in the whole wide world because I love this person more than life itself. I coded out a burger. I followed directions(thank you). I inserted pipelines or some such things. I have a CSS burger that does not move from right to left. I do have SQL data(I am not permitted save SQL files). I copy/pasted my code. I didn't do the string or the boolean, but I connected Heroku and Github. The command line does not acknowledge Heroku create. I do not know why. I worked crazy hard on this, and I know that I can make a dancing burger in my sleep now. Perhaps I could add snowflakes.
Update-I learned a lot in a short amount of time. Evidently,somebody taught me well. 
Programs Used: Code snippet/tutorial from CodePen to try to build burger. The silent mp4 video. Jaws Maria, and Jaws SQL. Heidi(which does not work on Macs...the more I know). Heroku, Github, SQL QuickStart Guide(by Walter Shields), the digitalocean article that Bart posted which pretty much saved me, GitHub, the cat activity, Mac Air, resillience.
