Abstract-
 
```I ot dog in my life for reasons you don't know, and if you try to give me one, I will be pissed. Now, about those muffins...
In said loved one's vernacular, "wawaho" means wonderful. My cold, black heart melts a little at hearing it. Wawaho is all-encompassing. Everything is fabulous. Everything is going to be okay all the time, even when it's not. Therefore, the burgers served at Wawaho Burgers and Fries are perfect all of the time. They might need to be cut into quarters. They might need to be tapped with two fingers. They might need to be held above one's face so one can determine that they are a legit burger. They might be eaten in the middle of watching "The Little Mermaid", which is the greatest Disney movie of all time, and came out in 1989. It was also the part of the cinematic rennaisance that saved Disney from bankruptcy, and is in fact the only animated movie wherein an octopus woman shimmies and obsessively reapplies her lipstick. But I digress...
Programs and Devices Used: It is my understanding that I am to use MYSQL, Heroku, the command line,seed.sql,and other things. I am going to bed now so that I may engage in project work tomorrow, and not become a "POOR....UN...FORTUNATE......SOUUUUUULLLLLLLL....". Fosse. Back soon.
