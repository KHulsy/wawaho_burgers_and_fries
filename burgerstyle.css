.burger {
  /* Contains all the parts of the burger */
  /* Bun, cheese, meat, lettuce, and sesame seeds */
}
But that's too limited, we won't be able to fit a whole burger inside a single selector. To find more space, we should use the :before and :after pseudo elements.

.burger {
  /* The cheese, meat, and lettuce */
}

.burger:before {
  /* The bun */
}

.burger:after {
  /* The sesame seeds */
}
